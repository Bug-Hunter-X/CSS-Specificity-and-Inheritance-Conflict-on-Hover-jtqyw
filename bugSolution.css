To solve this, you can either increase the specificity of the `div p` rule or use the `!important` flag:

**Solution 1 (Increasing Specificity):**

```css
div {
  color: blue;
}

p {
  color: red;
}

div > p {
  color: green; /* More specific selector */
}

div > p:hover {
  color: yellow;
}
```

By changing `div p` to `div > p`, we make the selector more specific, ensuring it overrides the inherited style.  `>` ensures that only direct children of `div` are affected.

**Solution 2 (Using !important):**

```css
div {
  color: blue;
}

p {
  color: red;
}

div p {
  color: green !important; /* Overrides inherited style */
}

div p:hover {
  color: yellow;
}
```

Using `!important` forces the `color: green` style to be applied, regardless of inheritance or other specificity considerations.  Use this approach sparingly as overuse can make your CSS harder to maintain.
