The following CSS code snippet demonstrates an uncommon error related to specificity and inheritance:

```css
div {
  color: blue;
}

p {
  color: red;
}

div p {
  color: green; /* This style is overridden */
}

div p:hover {
  color: yellow;
}
```

The unexpected behavior is that `div p:hover` inherits the `color: blue` from the `div` selector and adds `color: yellow`. The `color: green` style is not applied. This is due to the higher specificity of `div p:hover` compared to `div p`. Even though `div p` is defined, the inheritance and specificity of the more specific selector wins.

This is uncommon because many developers focus on the inheritance of style rules rather than the intricacies of specificity when it combines with inheritance.
